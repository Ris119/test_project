how to create repo for project

Put this in your actual project READ.ME and send to Sergey for review

By April 20 you will be expected to:

have talked with me about your project idea(s) and made a decision about what you're going to do. I can help you to choose between different ideas, advise you on the appropriate scope for your project, and ensure that your project question might reasonably be answerable using the data science tools and techniques taught in the course.

have created a GitHub repository for your project (even if it is a Kaggle competition). It should include a write-up that answers the following questions:

What is the question you hope to answer?
What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
What do you know about the data you're using so far?
Why did you choose this topic?
Note on including your data in your GitHub repo:

If it's not practical to include your entire dataset in your GitHub repository, you should link to your data source and provide a sample of the data. (GitHub has a size limit of 100 MB per file and 1 GB per repository.)
